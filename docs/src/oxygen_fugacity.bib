            A new thermodynamic model for silicate melt in the Na2O–CaO–K2O–FeO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2–TiO2–Fe2O3–Cr2O3 model system is presented, building on the tholeiitic through to granitic melt model of Holland et al. (2018) [Journal of Petrology, 59, 881–900] but extending for the first time into anhydrous alkaline systems. The new melt model is accompanied by new thermodynamic models for nepheline, kalsilite, leucite, melilite and ilmenite. Collectively these models enable pseudosection modelling of alkaline-silicate magmatic systems, providing a new tool for investigating this geologically- and economically-important compositional space. The models are calibrated with respect to experimental data on phase relations among minerals and melt, and the fit is benchmarked here via detailed comparison with seven experimental datasets, which encompass a range of pressure (0–22 kbar), temperature (680–1350°C), oxygen fugacity (log fO2 ΔFMQ-3 to +1), total alkali (3–16 wt \%) and silica (37–70 wt \%) conditions. The calculated pseudosections successfully reproduce experimental crystallisation sequences and phase compositions, indicating that the thermodynamic models are well calibrated across this spectrum of conditions. Redox buffered experimental conditions are simulated using oxygen buffered pseudosections. Contouring of oxygen buffered pseudosections with XFe3+ (mol. Fe3+/Fetotal), or pseudosections of varying XFe3+ with ΔFMQ, reveals (i) often complex and non-intuitive relationships between these two representations of oxidation state, and (ii) substantial variation in ferric iron over narrow temperature intervals in some oxygen buffered sets of experiments. An implication is that simulating oxygen buffering is vital when benchmarking thermodynamic models using experimental results. Furthermore, because natural igneous systems likely feature a near-constant XFe3+, it is important to assess experimental results in this framework when making inferences about natural systems, recognising that oxygen fugacity is a consequence not a control of phase equilibria in nature. Overall, our new models provide a novel tool to explore the role of variables, such as pressure, fractional crystallisation and crustal assimilation in the petrogenesis of alkaline-silicate magmatic systems and their associated mineralisation.},

	abstract = {Melting phase relations of a fertile lherzolite KLB‐1 have been studied in the pressure range from 1 atm to 14 GPa (140 kbar). Olivine is the liquidus phase at all pressures studied. The second mineral to crystallize changes with increasing pressure; chromian spinel (1 atm), Ca‐poor orthopyroxene (up to 3 GPa), pigeonitic clinopyroxene (up to 7 GPa), pyrope‐rich garnet (above 7 GPa). The melting temperature interval of the peridotite is more than 600°C wide at 1 atm but narrows to about 150°C at 14 GPa. The partial melts along the peridotite solidus become increasingly more MgO‐rich as pressure increases throughout the pressure range studied. At 5–7 GPa, the partial melts formed within 50°C of the solidus contain more than 30 wt \% MgO and are very similar to Al‐undepleted‐type peridotitic komatiite which is common in Archean volcanic terrains. Due to the increase of enstatite component in clinopyroxene solid solution at high pressure and temperature, the orthopyroxene liquidus field narrows as pressure increases and disappears at 3.5 GPa. Harzburgites which are common in the basal peridotite in ophiolite suites may have been produced as residues by partial melting at relatively shallower depths ({\textless} 100 km). Lherzolites showing protogranular textures might have been produced as single‐pyroxene peridotite residue by partial melting at relatively greater depths ({\textgreater} 100 km). A diapiric model is consistent with the genesis of komatiite magma by partial melting of mantle peridotite at 150–200 km depth. Based on the following observations, (1) convergence of the liquidus and solidus of the peridotite at pressures {\textgreater} 14 GPa, (2) the near solidus partial melt composition very close to the bulk rock at 14 GPa, and (3) change in liquidus mineral from olivine to majorite garnet at pressures between 16 and 20 GPa in preliminary experiments, it is proposed that the upper mantle peridotite was generated originally as a magma (or magmas) by partial melting of the primitive earth at 400–500 km depth.},
